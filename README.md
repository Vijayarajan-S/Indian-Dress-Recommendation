# Personalized Dress Recommendation System

The Personalized Dress Recommendation System is an application designed to suggest outfits to users based on their physical attributes and preferences. The system uses three machine learning models to detect face shape, body shape, and skin tone from the user's input, which includes age, height, weight, and image. The application leverages a custom dataset of Indian celebrities and provides fashion recommendations for different occasions like red carpet, casual, and traditional events. With intuitive background processing, the system predicts key attributes and delivers personalized clothing suggestions for an enhanced user experience.
